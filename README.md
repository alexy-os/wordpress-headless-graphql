## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your server:
```bash
cd /www
git clone [repository-url] .
```

2. Add the following constants to your wp-config.php:
```php
define('WP_ADMIN_PROTECTION', true);
define('CUSTOM_LOGIN_PATH', 'console');
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true);
```

3. Add the security rules to your .htaccess:
```apache
# Protect wp-login.php and wp-admin
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^wp-login\.php$ - [R=403,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-admin
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !wordpress_logged_in_ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [R=403,L]
</IfModule>
```

## Usage

### Accessing Admin Panel
1. Navigate to `/console/`
2. Get a temporary login link
3. Use the link within 30 minutes
4. Login with your WordPress credentials

### GraphQL simple queries
The GraphQL endpoint is available at `/graphql`. Example query:
```graphql
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    nodes {
      id
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

### GraphQL Usage with Field Restrictions

The GraphQL endpoint is available at `/graphql`. Example optimized query with controlled field exposure:

```graphql
{
  pages(first: 10) {
    nodes {
      id
      title
      featuredImage {
        node {
          id
          sourceUrl
          altText
        }
      }
      # Only exposed meta fields will be available
      pageFields {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Field Control
The MYGraphQL plugin allows you to:
- Explicitly define which meta fields are exposed
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Control featured image exposure
- Implement type-specific field restrictions

### Security Features
- Rate limiting is implemented at both IP and attempt levels
- All login attempts are logged in `/console/access.log`
- Security headers are automatically added to all responses
- Admin area is protected from unauthorized access
